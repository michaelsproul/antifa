*Warning: pre-alpha quality*

This is a tool for verifying the integrity of a file hierarchy by recursively hashing
its contents (i.e. building a Merkle tree).

One day it might be possible to use this to:

* Verify backups.
* Verify a root filesystem before booting (a kind of secure-boot thing).
* Smash fascism.
